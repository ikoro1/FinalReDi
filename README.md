Image Classification Web App - Technical Specification
Overview
This Flask web application allows users to upload an image, and it leverages pre-trained deep learning models (ResNet50, VGG16, ConvNeXtBase) to perform image classification. The results, including class names and confidence scores, are displayed on the web interface.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Flask
TensorFlow
Matplotlib
NumPy
Install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask tensorflow matplotlib numpy
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-web-app.git
cd image-classification-web-app
Run the Flask application:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5003/.
Configuration
The application supports the following command-line arguments:

-m or --model: Specify the deep learning model to use for classification (options: 'resnet50', 'vgg16', 'convnextbase'). Default is 'resnet50'.
Example:

bash
Copy code
python app.py -m vgg16
File Structure
app.py: The main Flask application file.
templates/index4.html: HTML template for the web interface.
uploads/: Folder where uploaded images are stored.
Image Processing
The process_image function in app.py is responsible for loading, preprocessing, and classifying the uploaded image. It uses TensorFlow and Matplotlib for image processing.

Web Interface
The web interface (index4.html) includes a form for file uploads, an image display, and a list of classification results. Results include the model name, class name, and confidence score.

Deployment
The application is configured to run on http://localhost:5003/ by default. For deployment in production, consider using a production-ready web server (e.g., Gunicorn) and configuring a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Apache).
